# Deployment Fixes for MotoBlog

This document outlines the changes made to fix deployment issues and prepare the MotoBlog site for GitHub Pages.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing Dependencies

- Created a custom `SimpleInfiniteScroll` component that doesn't rely on the `react-intersection-observer` library
- Used the native Intersection Observer API instead of the external library
- Updated the `InfiniteBlogPage` component to use the new scroll component

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration

- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Updated Next.js configuration to support static export
- Added base path handling for GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment
- Configured image optimization for static export

### 3. Static Export Requirements

- Added a custom 404 page for better user experience
- Added export script to package.json
- Configured Next.js to generate static HTML files
- Added .nojekyll file to prevent GitHub Pages from processing with Jekyll

## Deployment Process

The site is now configured to be deployed to GitHub Pages using the following process:

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow builds the site with the correct base path
3. Static files are exported to the `out` directory
4. The `out` directory is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch
5. GitHub Pages serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

## Testing Locally

To test the GitHub Pages build locally:

```bash
# Build with the base path
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/motoblog npm run build

# Export static files
npm run export

# Serve the static files
npx serve out
```

## Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **Image Loading**: If images fail to load on GitHub Pages, check that the paths are correctly prefixed with the base path.

2. **Navigation**: If navigation breaks, ensure all links use the Next.js `Link` component which handles the base path automatically.

3. **API Calls**: For any future API integration, make sure to prefix API endpoints with the base path when needed.

4. **404 Handling**: If 404 pages don't work correctly, check that the custom 404 page is being properly exported and copied to the root as `404.html`.

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive Web App**: Add PWA capabilities for offline access
2. **Preloading**: Implement preloading for common navigation paths
3. **CDN Integration**: Configure with a CDN for faster global access
4. **Compression**: Add Brotli/Gzip compression for static assets
